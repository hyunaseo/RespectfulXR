 Really important put the water on first so you can just have it gently simmering away ready for the pasta. While the water comes to the boil start the sauce by slicing mushrooms. First off, fingers, one in front, two behind, up and down. Then add olive oil to a hot frying pan. I want that nice colour on the mushrooms. Off the heat, literally 10 seconds. And when you toss something really important you get all the ingredients at the end of the pan. Push down and pull back. That noise that's all the water coming out of the mushrooms. Next, finely chop a fat clove of garlic. Then prepare your leeks. Just take your knife and go down through the centre, turn it over and again into quarters. See, all that opening up and then just rinse the top of that to get rid of any potential dirt or sand. It just breaks up into nice little quarters. Add all that leek into those mushrooms. Beautiful. And now the secret is to get rid of the water inside the leek. As it cooks down, all the water's gone, you can set it up. We'll do nice and tense flavour. Garlic's got nice and crispy. Now, we're going to add a touch of chicken stock in there. Beautiful. Lassagne sheets, just going to drop the sheets in to the water. Lassagne sheets are an unusual choice for a dish like this, but they work brilliantly. Although any type of pasta you've got in the cupboard will do. And just twist that pan. That stops any pasta actually sticking to the bottom of the pan. Chicken stock will reduce down by half. And it's almost delays the bottom of the pan. Basically washed all that wonderful flavour off. Turn the gas down. And add a couple of tablespoons of cream. This just enriches the dish, bringing it back up to the board and let it simmer for three to four minutes. Now, the secret of the pasta is just taking it out. A little early. So you've got that nice texture. Hold up the sheet and just nip it. And you can feel your fingers in the centre. It's ready. Turn the sauce down. And the lay. These beautiful sheets. And the sagne into that sauce. Just going to turn the gas off now. And let the pasta sit in there and absorb that amazing sauce. Finish with chopped fresh tarragon. So delicious herb that goes brilliantly well with mushrooms and leeks. Just let that sit, almost sort of infuse. To serve, I'm making a quick bruschetta by toasting fresh to batter bread. Two nice slices, drizzle that in olive oil. A little bit of garlic. Just rub the bread. The crust as well. The crust is what really takes that garlic. Now, pan for the bread. A little touch of olive oil. As it starts to smoke, bread in. But look at the pasta now. It's been stained by that amazing sauce to serve. And I spoon of my mushrooms, leeks and cream. Then I take my pasta, just twist it and let it sit on top. That tarragon has just lifted everything. Bread on. And that's the beauty about something so simple. You're done in 20 minutes with everyday ingredients. A stunning pasta dish. Adding easy and versatile dishes like this to your repertoire is what cooking at home is all about. So you can always make great tasting food at the drop of a hat. A fry off the chillis, the ginger, the garlic first. Sesame seed oil. Teaspoon, only in. Fry corn on the cob in olive oil. You want a really wonderfully charred flavor.
